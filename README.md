#Weather Forecast Application

### This project is currently : *In Progress*

I am current reworking and restyling a weather application project that was started while in Codeup's Full-Stack program. 
I am focusing on making the layout more appealing, as well as, responsive. I plan to then refactor the JS file are take care of 
a lot of repeated code, etc. Feel free to take a look at the progress I've made!
